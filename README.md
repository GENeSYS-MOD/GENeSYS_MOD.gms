## Introduction
![alt text](Docs/logo_simplified_2.png "GENeSYS-MOD Logo")

**GENeSYS-MOD v3.0 [Global Energy System Model]** with additional equations for ramping, ramping costs, and minimal runtime requirements. Test dataset for [Middle-earth] included.

GENeSYS-MOD is a linear program, minimizing total system costs. Energy demands are exogenously predefined and the model needs to provide the necessary capacities to meet them. To achieve a cost-optimal energy mix, the model considers a plethora of different technology options, including generation, sector coupling, and storages.

The default model run can be started by just executing the genesysmod.gms file. No further command-line parameters are required. Command line parameters can be provided via the GAMS IDE or when executing gams directly from the command line. E.g.:
```
gams.exe genesysmod.gms --switch_ccs=1 --switch_ramping --timeseries=elmod --nth=337
```


#### Command-Line parameters

| Parameter                 | Values        | Description                              |
|---------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| switch\_unixPath	       | 0,1           | Activates/Deactivates the usage of Unix (compared to Windows) file paths. |
| switch\_investLimit	       | 0,1           | Activates/Deactivates the investment-limits and capacity addition limits. |
| switch\_ccs                | 0,1           | Activates/Deactivates the investment into CCS technologies. |
| switch\_ramping            | 0,1           | Activates/Deactivates ramping and costs. **Note:** should only be used with a **timeseries=elmod**. |
| switch\_short\_term\_storage | 0,1           | Activates/Deactivates a more simple and easier to solve storage formulation that works with consecitive time-slices. **Note:** should only be used with a **timeseries=elmod** |
| switch\_all\_regions        | 0,1           | When activated all regions that are found in the input excel are computed. Else, only the first three regions are calculated. Used for debugging and testing. |
| switch\_infeasibility\_tech | 0,1           | Activates/Deactivates *infesability technologies*. These are very expensive arbitrary technologies that can fulfill every demand without other limitations. This parameter should be used to check if the available potential and existing capacities are sufficient to fulfill the inputted demand. |
| switch\_base\_year\_bounds   | 0,1           | Activates/Deactivates base year production limits. |
| switch\_only\_load\_gdx      | 0,1           | When set to 1, only gdx files will be loaded and no new gdx files will be generated from excel input files. |
| switch\_write\_output\_excel      | 0,1           | When set to 1, excel files from result gdx will be created. Otherwise, results are only written to .gdx files. |
|                           |               |                                          |
| solver                    | cplex,gurobi  | Sets the solver, currently only option files for *cplex* and *gurobi* are provided. Other solver can nonetheless be used and eneterd here. |
| model\_region              | user defined  | Sets the model region. Used for defining additional bounds and scenario parameters |
| data\_base\_region          | user defined  | Sets the base-region of the model run. When a technology parameter is not defined for a region, this here set region will be used as fallback.  <br>E.g., technology costs data is only definied for region 'CN-AH' in the input file. While loading the data, the cost data for all other regions will be also set to the costs for 'CN-AH'. |
| data_file                 | user defined  | Sets the input-file for obtaining general data. |
| hourly\_data\_file          | user defined  | Sets the input-file for obtaining hourly data. |
| timeseries                | classic,elmod | Switches between reduced hourly time-series and the classic OSeMOSY/GENeSYS-MOD timeslice approach. |
| elmod_nthhour                | (24\*n)+1; E.g., 337,169,121,73,49 | Defines the level of aggregation when using **timeseries=elmod**. |
| elmod_starthour                | (1-24) | Sets the starting hour of the time-series reduction algorithm when using **timeseries=elmod**. |
|                           |               |                                          |
| emissionPathway           | user defined  | User defined scenario pathway.           |
| emissionScenario          | user defined  | User defined scenario.           |



### Adding a new region to GENeSYS-MOD
#### 1. Set up data files
Set up and provide data files for general (data\_file) and hourly (hourly\_data\_file) data. Use existing files as template. Suggestion: copy and rename the existing files and try to run them as your new region.

#### 2. Add region-specific bounds file
Add new file **genesysmod\_scenariodata\_\[YOUR REGION\].gms**. This file is used to add scenarios for your case-study. Also, because this file is loaded after setting general bounds and limitiations, you can use is to overwrite predefinied bounds. Restrain from changing the general bounds as much as possible.

#### 3. Test your region and input files
Provide the new data-files via command-line parameter or change the default values in the **genesysmod.gms** file.

#### Further hints and tipps
* Start slow and change as little as much possible between the model runs
* Start with **timeseries=classic** and without ramping. The model size is greatly reduced and you can calibrate the base-year and general pathway transition of your model much easier.
